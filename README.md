# Round Robin Arbiter


Round-Robin (RR) is one of the most popular scheduling/arbitration algorithms. It guarantees fairness across different requests. Time slices (also known as time quanta)are assigned to each request in equal portions and in circular order, handling all requests without priority. It is simple, easy to implement, and starvation-free algorithm.

This project contains SVerilog implementiaiton, test-bench, documentation of RR scheluding.
