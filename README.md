# Round Robin Arbiter


Round-Robin (RR) is one of the most popular scheduling/arbitration algorithms. It guarantees fairness across different requests. Time slices (also known as time quanta)are assigned to each request in equal portions and in circular order, handling all requests without priority. Round-robin scheduling is simple, easy to implement, and starvation-free.

This project contains SVerilog implementiaiton of RR scheduling algirithm.
